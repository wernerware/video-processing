# Wernerware  Video Processing
This is a scripting project created to assist me in transferring video files off of a usb drive and processing them using Handbrake.  It does not work yet because it is a work in progress.  Furthermore, for the time being, it is designed to fit my own situation rather handly and zero effort has been taken to generalize the technologies or platforms used.
